# CNN-for-CIFAR-10-image-classification

This repository contains an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a CNN model that can accurately classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 different classes. The project includes the following steps:

1. Data preprocessing
2. Model architecture design
3. Model training and evaluation
4. Results visualization

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

## Model Architecture

The CNN architecture used in this project includes:
- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- Max-pooling layers
- Fully connected layers
- Softmax activation for the output layer

## Installation

To run the project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- NumPy
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy tensorflow keras matplotlib
